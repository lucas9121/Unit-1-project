# Wars of Vogrora

Game description:
Player can choose one of three races when creating a Character (elf, human, dwarf) that have default skills to them (recovery, stamina, intelect). The skills can be seen on the main page ny hovering on the character's name on the top left. Each race can choose a class speciealty(range, melee, magic) before starting the game. Battle main vilain and his army (faction with member of each race) with your character. There are 10 battles before reaching main vilain. The battle right before the main villain is a mini boss that is stronger than the previous 9 enemies. Main vilain has higher hp, attack, and defense then other enemies. Each race has a particular skill they are better in. The skill influences their advantage on work/eat results. Work grants money and uses energy. The only way to replinish energy is by eating food. Food has to be bought with some of the money you have. Money can also be used to purchase potions in th store that will help you in a battle. You will need at least two potions to defeat the mini boss. You will need at least 9 potions (combination of 5 atk, 4 def or 4 atk, 5 def) to defeat final boss. After defeating the final boss you have the option to replay the campaign by clicking on the fight button again (which will now say replay). If you click on it all of your stats, money and energy is reset.
